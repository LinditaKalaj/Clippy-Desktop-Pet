Do you miss Clippy? Me too. So I made a desktop pet in his image!
Double click on him to open up a chat window to speak with him.

## OpenAI
You'll need an OpenAI api key for the chat function.
Visit https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys. You'll need to log in to your account but as of writing this the API is free to use (Up to $18.00 in credits for 3 months with .02 cents per 1k tokens). You then can generate a new secret key but just like the discord token, it can only be viewed once. Place the key in the OPENAI_API_KEY variable in the .env file.

## Known Issues
He has an outline around him when his window is focused on MacOS.
